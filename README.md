SynthIR focuses on the system-level implications of AI-generated content in retrieval ecosystems, emphasizing evaluation validity, provenance, user trust, and human-centered design in mixed (synthetic + human-authored) information environments.

[[Submission Site]](https://openreview.net/)

## News
- 22/4/2024 - Workshop homepage is now available.

## Important Dates
Please note: deadlines are at 11:59 p.m. of the stated deadline date [Anywhere on Earth](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth)

- **Submission deadline:** 7 April 2026  
- **Notification:** 22 April 2026  
- **Camera-ready:** 29 April 2026  

## Abstract
The proliferation of AI-generated content is fundamentally altering the information ecosystems in which retrieval systems operate. Search engines, recommender systems, and retrieval-augmented generation pipelines increasingly function in mixed environments where synthetic and human-authored content are tightly interwoven, raising system-level challenges for information retrieval. SynthIR provides a forum to examine these implications with emphasis on reflection, evaluation, and human-centered system design, and to foster community discussion that may inform future evaluation efforts and shared tasks.

## Themes and Discussion Tasks
**Focus areas** include evaluation validity, provenance/attribution, grounding and trust signals, and user interaction in AIGC-aware IR systems.

**Micro shared tasks** (lightweight analytical exercises):
- **Task A: AIGC in ranked retrieval results** — ranking placement, perceived quality, provenance signals, and evaluation gaps.
- **Task B: AIGC in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** — factual alignment, attribution quality, hallucination patterns, and trust signals.
- **Task C: Model provenance and attribution** — provenance availability, attribution granularity, uncertainty representation, and impact on ranking/trust.
- **Case study:** sequential AIGC edits and provenance challenges in IR.

## Submission Guidelines
Full research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published (except on pre-print servers, see below for details), not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2026). Please note that concurrent submissions are a violation of the [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship). The SIGIR 2026 program chairs will refer any such violations to the [Ethics & Plagiarism Committee](https://www.acm.org/publications/publications-board-committees) of the ACM Publications Board.

Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 4 pages (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references) in length, with unrestricted space for references, in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf templates are available from the [ACM Website](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) (use “sigconf” proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word). ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are required for review.

For LaTeX, the following should be used:

\documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}

## Workshop Format and Tentative Schedule
SynthIR is planned as a highly interactive half-day workshop, structured to move from shared context setting to task-driven analysis and participant-driven discussion.

| Time | Agenda |
|---|---|
| 09:00–09:10 | Welcome and framing of workshop goals |
| 09:10–09:50 | Keynote and moderated discussion |
| 09:50–10:40 | Panel discussion with audience interaction |
| 10:40–11:00 | Break |
| 11:00–12:15 | Thematic discussion sessions and informal exchange |
| 12:15–12:45 | Synthesis of discussion outcomes and closing remarks |
